### QGIS-Plugin for editing Linear Referencing Systems
The plugin consists of a complete toolset for building and managing Linear Referencing Systems. It adds functionality for creating and editing Point-, Tour- and Continuous (linear) Events referencing any network of linear features. Measures and route ID are managed dynamically, external data can be imported, data checks are included and Tour- and Continuous Events are additionally represented in a separate line layer. Data is stored in a PostGIS database.

Tested and used up to now with Swiss Coordinate Reference System. Detailed manual is available in german under [documentation](https://github.com/Holenstein-Ingenieure-AG/lrs-editor/tree/main/documentation).
